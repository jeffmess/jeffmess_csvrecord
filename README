A small program I wrote to learn about meta programming.

Todo
----

1. Still need to refactor the code to read csv files in other directories.
2. Replace header spaces with underscores for instance variables.
3. Package as Gem

How to use

jeffmess$ cat author.csv 
"FirstName",LastName,age
Paul,"Johnson",87
"Douglas","Hofstadter",60
jeffmess$ irb
>> require 'lib/csvrecord'
=> true
>> CsvRecord.make("author.csv")
=> Author
>> records = Author.read
=> [#<Author:0x1010e7930 @lastname="Johnson", @age="87", @firstname="Paul">, #<Author:0x1010e6e90 @lastname="Hofstadter", @age="60", @firstname="Douglas">]
>> records.each do |author|
?>   puts author.firstname + " " + author.lastname
>> end
Paul Johnson
